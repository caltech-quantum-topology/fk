You are to write a **Python script** that compares **two sets of FK polynomials** computed using different programs.

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Create a Python program that compares FK polynomials stored in two data sources:

1. The **source of truth** is in a file called `fibered_table.json`.
2. The **computed results** are JSON files inside a directory `results/`.

The comparison should verify whether the FK polynomials from both sources **match** under the following conditions:

* FK polynomials are in **two variables**, ( x ) and ( q ).
* Powers of ( x ) are always **non-negative integers**.
* Powers of ( q ) can be **negative** (so ( q ) terms form a Laurent polynomial).
* Two FK polynomials **match** if they are identical up to the **minimum (x)-degree** present in both, possibly differing by an overall factor of **–1**.

---

### 📁 **Data Format**

#### In `fibered_table.json`

Each entry has a `"name"` (e.g., `"knot_6_1"`) that matches the filename in the `results/` directory.

Each entry includes a field:

```json
"fk_x_coeffs": "{0,0,q,7*q,7 + 28*q - q^2,48 + q^(-2) + 22/q + 89*q - 7*q^2 - 6*q^3}"
```

Interpretation rules:

* The curly braces `{...}` represent a **list of coefficients** ordered by their (x)-degree.
* The element at index *i* is the coefficient of (x^i).
* Each coefficient is itself a **Laurent polynomial in (q)**.

So the above example corresponds to:
[
\text{FK}(x,q) = qx^2 + 7qx^3 + (7 + 28q - q^2)x^4 + (48 + q^{-2} + 22/q + 89q - 7q^2 - 6q^3)x^5
]

---

#### In `results/`

Each file (e.g. `results/knot_6_1.json`) explicitly encodes the FK polynomial as:

```json
{
  "terms": [
    {
      "x": [degree],
      "q_terms": [
        {"q": q_power, "c": coefficient},
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

That is, the polynomial is a sum over (x^{degree}), with each term having a list of ((q^{power}, coefficient)) pairs.

### 🧮 **Required Functionality**

The program must:

1. Load `fibered_table.json` and all `results/*.json`.
2. Parse the FK polynomial from each source into a comparable canonical form.
3. Compare both polynomials:

   * They match if one equals the other or its negative, up to the **minimum x-degree** between them.
4. Print a detailed comparison report:

   * Which knots match fully.
   * Which differ (and by what factor if it’s –1).
   * Optionally print the mismatched coefficients.

The script should be modular, with clear helper functions like:

* `parse_fk_from_fibered_table(entry)`
* `parse_fk_from_result(result_data)`
* `compare_polynomials(poly1, poly2)`

and should use dictionaries to represent polynomials, e.g. `{(x_degree, q_power): coefficient}`.

---

### ✅ **Deliverable**

Provide:

* A single, well-documented Python script implementing this comparison.
* Clear comments explaining the data parsing, normalization, and comparison logic.
* Console output showing which knots matched and which didn’t.
