# fk
computation of Gukov-Manolescu FK series and related things

## TO DO:

1.) We should be able to call `python sign_diagram.py [1,1,1]` and get a sign diagram for the braid printed to the standard out

2.) We should be able to call, e.g. `fk [1,1,1] [1,1,1,1,1,1]` (that is a braid and a sign diagram) and get the fk terms coefficients, as a list of lists, printed to standard out
